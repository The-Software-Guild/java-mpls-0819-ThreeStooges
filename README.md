# java-mpls-0819-ThreeStooges

This was a group project made by three aprentices at The Software Guild. It is a full stack java web application made using Spring boot. Users are able to create postings to sell shoes and other users were able to place bids and buy these shoes. The program used JPA to read and persist data in a MySQL database as well as Thymeleaf to dynamically fill in HTML templates with the necessary information.
