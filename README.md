# java-mpls-0819-ThreeStooges

This is a group project made by three apprentices at The Software Guild. It is a full stack java Spring web application of a sneaker marketplace. Sellers are able to create postings to sell shoes and other users are able to place bids and buy these shoes. The program uses JPA to read and persist data in a MySQL database and Thymeleaf to dynamically fill in HTML templates with the necessary information to be displayed in your browser.

Check out the project online at https://sneakermarketplace.herokuapp.com/. The app may take a few minutes to wake up before running normally.
